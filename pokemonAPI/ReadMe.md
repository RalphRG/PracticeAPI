# Pokemon API
 Just a Simple search for pokemons using pokemon https://pokeapi.co/api
 
 I can probably include some stats when they are searched not just display the name and picture but this will do for now.

 I can also put an error message if the pokemon does not exist

## Things I want to improve but don't know how

 1. I wanted to make it so that the background of the webpage is the same color as the dominant color of the pokemon
 2. Testing if my git works
